        <Warning>
        Error handling:
        - The grant must be captured within 15 minutes of authorization otherwise the request will return status `410 Gone`.
        - If this request is submitted while this grant is already being processed, the request will return status `409 Conflict`.
        - The amount must be in whole dollar increments (rounded to the nearest hundred) as currently DAFs only accept whole dollar grants otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be greater than or equal to the minimum grant amount for the DAF otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be less than or equal to the user's DAF account balance otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.

        - A recurring grant can only be captured once from any given workflow session so any duplicate requests will return status `409 Conflict`.
        - The amount must be in whole dollar increments (rounded to the nearest hundred) as currently DAFs only accept whole dollar grants otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be greater than or equal to the minimum grant amount for the DAF otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be less than or equal to the user's DAF account balance otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - Any inputs exceeding the maximum allowed length will be automatically truncated unless otherwise stated.

        The disbursement must have a status of `submitted`.
        This only applies for disbursements sent via ACH or check.

        - **ACH disbursements**: Status becomes `failed` (payment was returned and cannot be retried)
        - **Check disbursements**: Status becomes `validating_organization` (check was returned). When this happens, Chariot will investigate why the check failed to reach the organization, update any required recipient information (such as mailing address or organization contact details), and automatically reattempt payout once the issue is resolved.

      summary: Create an Inbound transfer
      description: |-
        Create an inbound transfer to fund your financial account
        from an externally linked bank account.
        In Production, this requires that an external bank account has been setup
        and verified for your account through the Chariot Dashboard.

        **Settlement timing:** ACH debits typically take 3-4 business days to settle.
        Once the transfer completes, the funds are added to the financial account's available balance
        and can be used to fund disbursements. Funds are not earmarked for any specific disbursement;
        they increase the shared balance pool.

        For funding best practices, see the [Flow of Funds](/guides/disbursements/flow-of-funds) guide.

        A Connect represents an instance of Chariot Connect for a particular nonprofit. A nonprofit organization will create Connect objects in order to integrate Chariot Connect into their websites or fundraising platforms to start accepting donations directly from Donor Advised Funds. Each nonprofit can have multiple Connect objects where each one represents a logical separation for how the organization wants to organize their sources of donations. For example, they might have 2 Connect instances, one that they use to integrate Chariot Connect directly on their website and the other that they provide to a 3rd party fundraising platform. On the client side, Chariot Connect is instantiated with the `id` of the Connect object, also called the `cid`. A connect object also contains an `apiKey`. This is useful for nonprofits to provide to fundraising platforms on their behalf to programatically integrate Chariot Connect and access resources and information created from the Connect instance through various Chariot API endpoints. More information on integrating Chariot Connect into a client-side application can be found here: https://givechariot.readme.io

        The recurring grant will continue indefinitely until the donor runs out of funds or until the donor cancels the recurring grant with their DAF provider.
        Some DAF providers require an end-date or number of payments in order to create a recurring grant.
        In most cases, the recurring grant will continue indefinitely until the donor's account runs out of funds or until the donor cancels the recurring grant with their DAF provider.
        Some DAF providers require an explicit bound to the time period or the number of payments in which case currently we opt for the longest recurring donation timeline possible.
        For example, if the DAF provider allows recurring donations to continue for up to 10 years we will submit the request as such.
