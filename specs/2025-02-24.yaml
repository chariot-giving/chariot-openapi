        <Warning>
        Error handling:
        - The grant must be captured within 15 minutes of authorization otherwise the request will return status `410 Gone`.
        - If this request is submitted while this grant is already being processed, the request will return status `409 Conflict`.
        - The amount must be in whole dollar increments (rounded to the nearest hundred) as currently DAFs only accept whole dollar grants otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be greater than or equal to the minimum grant amount for the DAF otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be less than or equal to the user's DAF account balance otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - Any inputs exceeding the maximum allowed length will be automatically truncated.

        - The recurring grant must be captured within 15 minutes of authorization otherwise the request will return status `410 Gone`.
        - A recurring grant can only be captured once from any given workflow session so any duplicate requests will return status `409 Conflict`.
        - The amount must be in whole dollar increments (rounded to the nearest hundred) as currently DAFs only accept whole dollar grants otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be greater than or equal to the minimum grant amount for the DAF otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - The amount must be less than or equal to the user's DAF account balance otherwise the request will return status `400 Bad Request`.
        - Any inputs exceeding the maximum allowed length will be automatically truncated unless otherwise stated.

        Simulates a payment failure or return for testing purposes.
        The disbursement must have a status of `submitted`.
        This only applies for disbursements sent via ACH or check.

        - **ACH disbursements**: Status becomes `failed` (payment was returned and cannot be retried)
        - **Check disbursements**: Status becomes `validating_organization` (check was returned). When this happens, Chariot will investigate why the check failed to reach the organization, update any required recipient information (such as mailing address or organization contact details), and automatically reattempt payout once the issue is resolved.

        Virtual Accounts make it easy to independently manage and consolidate incoming payments and donations from different sources
        which in turn makes reconciliation of money and data seamless.
        Every Virtual Account belongs to a specific Financial Account and can be thought of as a gateway/door for money to flow into the Financial Account.
        Virtual Accounts are not separately ledgered which means you can't get the balance of a Virtual Account separately from the Financial Account.

        A Connect represents an instance of Chariot Connect for a particular nonprofit. A nonprofit organization will create Connect objects in order to integrate Chariot Connect into their websites or fundraising platforms to start accepting donations directly from Donor Advised Funds. Each nonprofit can have multiple Connect objects where each one represents a logical separation for how the organization wants to organize their sources of donations. For example, they might have 2 Connect instances, one that they use to integrate Chariot Connect directly on their website and the other that they provide to a 3rd party fundraising platform. On the client side, Chariot Connect is instantiated with the `id` of the Connect object, also called the `cid`. A connect object also contains an `apiKey`. This is useful for nonprofits to provide to fundraising platforms on their behalf to programatically integrate Chariot Connect and access resources and information created from the Connect instance through various Chariot API endpoints. More information on integrating Chariot Connect into a client-side application can be found here: https://givechariot.readme.io
