When building your application, you'll likely want to fully test functionality in the sandbox environment before going live.
Chariot provides a set of Simulation APIs, which are only available in Sandbox.
These APIs allow you to quickly test financial related events that might take long periods of time to occur in the real world (Production).

You'll see Sandbox Simulation APIs are prefixed with `/v1/simulations` path, have the `Sandbox:` prefix as part of the title, and
should always contain the following callout in the description:
