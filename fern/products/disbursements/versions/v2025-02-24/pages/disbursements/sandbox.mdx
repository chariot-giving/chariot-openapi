When building your application, you'll likely want to fully test functionality in the sandbox environment before going live.

All APIs in these docs are available in Sandbox.

Additionally, Chariot provides a set of [Simulation APIs](/api/sandbox-simulations), which are only available in Sandbox.
These APIs allow you to quickly test financial related events that might take long periods of time to occur in the real world (Production).

If you have a sandbox Event Subscription configured, calling these APIs will also result in the appropriate webhooks being sent to your endpoint.

## Sandbox Lifecycle

To adequately test the various [disbursement payment rails](/guides/disbursements/disbursement-lifecycle#payment-rail-lifecycle) (Account, ACH, Check), 
you'll need to make use of a fixed set of test nonprofit Organizations that have been pre-configured in the Sandbox environment.

The following Organizations will allow you test the various disbursement payment rails:

| EIN | Transfer Type |
| --- | ------------ |
| 752456162 | [Account transfer](/guides/disbursements/disbursement-lifecycle#account-transfer) |
| 861649851 | [ACH transfer](/guides/disbursements/disbursement-lifecycle#ach) |
| 132555281 | [Check transfer](/guides/disbursements/disbursement-lifecycle#mailed-check) |
