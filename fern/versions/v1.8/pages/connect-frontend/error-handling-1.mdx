### Minimum donation requirement and insufficient account balances

If a donor tries to submit a grant request for an amount that exceeds their current account balance, Connect will alert the donor and suggest the donor to adjust the donation amount to the available account balance. Additionally, if a Donor Advised Fund platform has a minimum donation requirement, Connect will alert donors of this requirement and suggest the donor to alter the donation size to match the minimum threshold for submission.
