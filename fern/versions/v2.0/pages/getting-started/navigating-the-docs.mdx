The Chariot documentation is broken up into two main parts: 

1. [Chariot Connect](integrating-connect): The frontend, client-side component that launches [DAFPay](https://www.dafpay.com/): the application that users interact with in order to initiate grant requests from their Donor Advised Funds. Both React and Javascript SDKs are available. 
2. [Chariot API](overview): The backend endpoints needed to register new nonprofits, submit grants, and query for transactional data and events. All endpoints much be authenticated using OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow.
