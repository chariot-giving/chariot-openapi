    <Accordion title="How can my platform collect our processing fees?">

        In the [Create Grant](/api-reference/grants/create) endpoint, there is a parameter named `applicationFeeAmount`.
        This will allow the caller to pass in a processing fee for the grant.
        Chariot will then either deduct that amount before paying out the nonprofit or invoice the fees from the Nonprofit and send the fees in a cadence according to an agreed-upon contract.

    <Accordion title="How can I run form validations before the Connect button launches?">

        To perform form validation before Chariot Connect launches, simply return `false` in the onDonationRequest.
        Please see  [Integrating Connect](/integrating-connect) to learn more.

    <Accordion title="How can donors cover fees?">

        If a donor wishes to cover the fees, increase the final amount sent to the [Create Grant](/api-reference/grants/create) route to compensate for the processing fees.
        Take into consideration that increasing the final amount also raises the processing fee 
        and **don't forget to round the final amount to a whole dollar (nearest 100) as DAFs only allow grants in dollar increments**.

        To calculate the final amount you can use the following formula:

    <Accordion title="What is the DAFpay Network?">

        For nonprofits that haven't completed onboarding and verification with Chariot, 
        DAFpay routes payments through a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity named [DAFpay Network](https://www.dafpaynetwork.org/).
        The DAFpay Network then sends the funds to the nonprofit minus processing fees.
        This enables DAFpay to accommodate payments to all eligible 501(c)(3) nonprofits for receiving DAF (Donor-Advised Fund) donations.
