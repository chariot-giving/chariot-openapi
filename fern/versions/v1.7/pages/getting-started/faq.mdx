### How can my platform collect our processing fees?

In the [Create Grant](/api-reference/grants/create) endpoint, there is a parameter named `applicationFeeAmount`. This will allow the caller to pass in a processing fee for the grant. Chariot will then either deduct that amount before paying out the nonprofit or invoice the fees from the Nonprofit and send the fees in a cadence according to an agreed-upon contract.

### How can I run form validations before the Connect button launches?

To perform form validation before Chariot Connect launches, simply return `false` in the onDonationRequest. Please see  [Integrating Connect](/integrating-connect) to learn more.

### How can donors cover fees?

If a donor wishes to cover the fees, increase the final amount sent to the [Create Grant](/api-reference/grants/create) route to compensate for the processing fees. Take into consideration that increasing the final amount also raises the processing fee and **don't forget to round the final amount to a whole dollar (nearest 100) as DaFs only allow grants in dollar increments**.

To calculate the final amount you can use the following formula:

### What is the DaFpay Network?

For nonprofits that haven't completed onboarding and verification with Chariot, DaFpay routes payments through a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity named [DaFpay Network](https://www.dafpaynetwork.org/). The DaFpay Network then sends the funds to the nonprofit minus processing fees. This enables DaFpay to accommodate payments to all eligible 501(c)(3) nonprofits for receiving DaF (Donor-Advised Fund) donations.
