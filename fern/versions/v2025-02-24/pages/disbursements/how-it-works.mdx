To get started with Chariot Disbursements, you'll need to register for an account with Chariot and go through an onboarding process.
After you are approved and verified, you'll be given access to a dashboard where you will be able to manage and create `API Keys`.
You'll also need to fund your Chariot account with the amount of money you'd like to send in disbursements.


## Send a Disbursement

This section provides the steps required to send a disbursement via API. Note, you can also initiate and send disbursements directly from your dashboard.

<Steps>

### Find an Organization

Search for the nonprofit organization using their name or EIN:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/organizations/search" />



### Create a Disbursement

Next, create a `Disbursement` to the Organization with the amount that you want to send.

You can create multiple `Transactions` for a single `Disbursement` to attribute multiple individual donations to the same `Disbursement`.

{/* <Note>
You can attach a document or file to the payment by [first uploading a file to Chariot's servers](/v2024-10-30/api/files/upload-file)
and then creating a `Transaction` with the `attachment_file_id` field populated.
</Note> */}

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/disbursements"  example="MultipleTransactions"/>

Once you receive a successful response, Chariot will use the funds in your account to push a payment to the organization.
You can call the [GET Disbursement](/api/disbursements/get) endpoint to see the status of the submission.

To learn more about how to handle errors, please refer to the [FAQ](/guides/disbursements/faq).

## How Chariot Disbursements Works for Nonprofits

Chariot provides a service to nonprofits to facilitate receiving disbursements from grantmakers and other platforms.

If a nonprofit has a DDA Account<span title="Chariot is a financial technology company, not a bank. Chariot Accounts come with a Demand Deposit Account through our banking services partner, Column N.A., Member FDIC. Deposits in Chariot Accounts are eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor, for each insurable capacity in which the account is held."><sup><Icon icon="fa-regular fa-circle-info" size="2.5"/></sup></span>, Chariot is able to present a consolidated view of all payments received by the nonprofit in their dashboard across all grantmakers. In this case, a payment should settle instantly.

If a nonprofit does not have a DDA Account<span title="Chariot is a financial technology company, not a bank. Chariot Accounts come with a Demand Deposit Account through our banking services partner, Column N.A., Member FDIC. Deposits in Chariot Accounts are eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor, for each insurable capacity in which the account is held."><sup><Icon icon="fa-regular fa-circle-info" size="2.5"/></sup></span> with Chariot, they can still receive payments via Chariot's Disbursements. In this case, Chariot will mail a paper check to the nonprofit's verified postal address.

{/* ## Managing Disbursements

Chariot offers several ways to manage disbursements.

### Use Chariot's Hosted Payment Solution

<Tip>
Recommended: Lowest friction, zero compliance overhead.
</Tip>

In this flow, the grantmakers use Chariot's hosted payment solution to send payments to the Organizations.
This option is ideal for grantmakers that do not want to manage their own Accounts Payable systems and/or want to offload the responsibility of sending payments and managing compliance altogether.

### Manage Your Own

<Warning>
Caution: Requires compliance overhead and being able to send payments via Check or electronically.
</Warning>

In this flow, the grantmakers call the API to read the public-facing `Address`
and create a payment intent for a payment that will be sent via the appropriate payment rail.
This option is great for grantmakers that manage their own Accounts Payable systems or already have capabilities to send payments.

### Delegate to Accounts Payable Systems

<Info>
If this is something that you are interested in, please reach out to us at contact@givechariot.com.
</Info>

In this flow, the grantmakers delegate `Chariot` API access to their Accounts Payable systems via an OAuth application.
The Accounts Payable systems can then read the Organization's `Address` via API and send a payment via the appropriate payment network.
Note that this method requires Chariot to offer OAuth and for charitable AP systems to have built an integration with the `Chariot` API. */}
