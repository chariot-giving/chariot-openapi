A Disbursment can be submitted through different payment rails. Each payment rail has a different payment lifecycle. To view which  payment rail a Disbursment is using, check the `submission` in a Disbursement object.

## Book Transfer :zap:

A Book Transfer happen instantly and can be sent 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If a nonprofit has an account with Chariot, Chariot will send funds using this payment rail.

Since Book Transfers are instant, they don't have a payment lifecycle and funds are available to the nonprofit immediately.

## Check
A check submission represents a paper check that is sent to the receiving organization. This is the submission method used when the receiving organization does not have a Chariot account.
