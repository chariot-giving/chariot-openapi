## Disbursement `status` lifecycle
A Disbursement's `status` represents a workflow lifecycle.

It tracks whether a Disbursement has been approved or canceled by your organization based on your organization's configured approval rules.
Additionally, it tracks if the Disbursement has been verified by the Chariot team.

Once a Disbursement's status is `submitted`, a request will be made to the preferred payment rail to initiate the payment.
A Disbursement with a `submitted` status will have a `submission` object.

Once a Disbursement is `submitted`, it can no longer be canceled. Instead, depending on the payment rail the submission may be able to be stopped or reversed.

 Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending_approval` | The disbursement is awaiting approval from the grantmaker |
| `canceled` | The disbursement was canceled by the grantmaker |
| `pending_verification` | The disbursement is awaiting verification from Chariot |
| `rejected` | The disbursement was rejected by Chariot before being submitted|
| `pending_submission` | The disbursement is awaiting submission to the payment rail|
| `submitted` | The disbursement has been submitted to the payment rail |

## Payment Rail Lifecycle
Once a Disbursement contains a `submission`, a payment has been initiated through a specific payment rail. Each payment rail follows its own distinct payment lifecycle.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Account Transfer">
        A Account Transfer happens instantly and can be sent 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If a nonprofit has an account with Chariot, Chariot will send funds using this payment rail.

        Since Account Transfers are instant, they don't have a payment lifecycle and funds are available to the nonprofit immediately.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Mailed Check">
    A check submission represents a paper check that is sent to the receiving organization by mail. This is the submission method used when the receiving organization does not have a Chariot account.
