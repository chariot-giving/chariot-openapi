        The request should include the following information:

        - Website
        - Fiscal sponsor information

    <Accordion title="What if a nonprofit is ineligible for disbursements?">

        If a nonprofit is ineligible for disbursements, the organization's `organization.compliance.daf_eligible` field will be `false`.
        The organization will not be able to receive disbursements from grantmakers.

        If you believe that the organization should be eligible for disbursements, please reach out to [Compliance](mailto:compliance@givechariot.com).

    ## Payment Rails

    ### Checks
    If a Nonprofit does not have an account with Chariot, Chariot will mail a paper check to the nonprofit's verified payment address. We strongly recommend that nonprofits sign up for a free account with Chariot to receive future disbursements electronically.

    ### Electronic (ACH, RTP, etc.)
    If a Nonprofit has an account with Chariot, they can receive payments electronically to their verified bank account. Chariot is able to present a consolidated view of all payments received by the nonprofit in their dashboard across all grantmakers. In this case, a payment may settle almost instantly.

    </Accordion>

     <Accordion title="How to handle returned checks?">
       If a check is returned, the Disbursement's check submission status will be `returned`. If the check was returned because the mailing address was outdated,
       the grantmaker can let Chairot's compliance team know in order to update the most recent mailing address. Afterwards, a disbursement can be resubmitted.
