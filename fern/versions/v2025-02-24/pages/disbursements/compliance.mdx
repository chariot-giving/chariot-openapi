## Compliance
Chariot stays up to date with the latest IRS guidelines to determine which organizations are eligible to receive donations.


Chariot simplifies eligibility into a simple boolean field `organization.compliance.daf_eligible` on the `Organization` object.
For details on how this boolean is calculated, please [click here to learn more.](https://intercom.help/givechariot/en/articles/10950166-how-does-chariot-assess-a-nonprofit-s-eligibility). If you'd like to determine organization eligibility independently,
you can use the additional fields in the `organization.compliance` section.

## Fraud Prevention
Chariot has rigorous verification procedures designed to help reduce fraud for both electronic and check payments.

#### Electronic Payments
Chariot's Electronic Payment Verification process represents an advancement over current industry practices.
Instead of simply validating payment pointers (account/routing numbers) using bank statements, Chariot focuses on validating officer
identities through IRS master files and top-tier identity verification providers.

#### Check Payments
Chariot's Check Payment Verification process tailors validation methods based on donation amount, prior payment history,
and address verification through sources like the IRS Business Master File and the nonprofit's website. The system
incorporates automated outreach, direct contact for larger payments, an adaptable risk engine to help reduce fraud,
and important controls like Positive Pay protections and delivery tracking to ensure payment reaches the intended nonprofit.
