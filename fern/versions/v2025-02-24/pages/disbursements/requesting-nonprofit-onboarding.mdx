When a nonprofit doesn't exist in Chariot's system, you can request their onboarding using the [Create Request](/api/organizations/create-organization-request) endpoint. Once approved, you'll be able to send disbursements to them.

## How It Works

1. Search for a nonprofit using the [Search Organizations](/api/organizations/search-organizations) endpoint
2. If not found, create an onboarding request with the nonprofit's EIN and contact information
3. The nonprofit receives an invitation email (if contact email provided)
4. Track the request status using the [List Requests](/api/organizations/list-organization-requests) endpoint
5. Once approved, the nonprofit appears in organization searches and the `organization_id` is populated in the request

## Request Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending_invite` | Request created but invitation not yet sent to the nonprofit |
| `request_sent` | Invitation email has been sent to the nonprofit's contact |
| `started_onboarding` | Nonprofit has begun filling out their onboarding application. The `organization_id` field is now populated. |
| `in_review` | Nonprofit completed onboarding, pending Chariot compliance review |
| `approved` | Nonprofit is fully onboarded and can receive disbursements |

<Note>
The status automatically updates as the nonprofit progresses through onboarding. You don't need to take any action once the request is created. Once the status reaches `started_onboarding` or later, the `organization_id` field will contain the ID of the onboarded organization.
</Note>

## Creating a Request

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/organization_requests" />

**Required Fields:**
- `ein`: The nonprofit's 9-digit Employer Identification Number
- `organization_name`: The legal name of the nonprofit

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `contact_email`: Enables automatic invitation email to the nonprofit
- `website`: Helps verify the organization's legitimacy
- `line1`, `line2`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`: Assists with compliance verification
- `contact_phone`: Provides additional contact method (E.164 format)

<Tip>
Providing a contact email significantly speeds up the onboarding process as the nonprofit receives an immediate invitation.
</Tip>

## Duplicate Requests

The API returns a `409 Conflict` error if you try to request onboarding for an EIN you've already requested. Use the [List Requests](/api/organizations/list-organization-requests) endpoint to check existing requests.

<Warning>
If the nonprofit with the given EIN already exists and is eligible for disbursements, the API will return a `412 Precondition Failed` error. Use the [Search Organizations](/api/organizations/search-organizations) endpoint to verify eligibility first.
</Warning>
