### Donor Accounts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How does a donor request a Donor Account?">
        When a donor uses DAFpay for the first time, they select their DAF provider and create their DAFpay account. This automatically creates a Donor Account request for the grantmaker. Donors can then submit grant requests in DAFpay, which will show up under this Donor Account.

        Each Donor Account should reference an external account in the grantmaker's system. Therefore, when grant requests are made, the grantmaker should know which account to apply the grant request to in their external system.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can a Donor Account be revoked?">
        Yes, either via the [Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/update) or the Chariot Dashboard, the donor's account can be revoked from DAFpay. When revoked, the user won't be able to submit grant requests to this Donor Account via their DAFpay account.

        To revoke a Donor Account, update its status to `revoked` using the Update Donor Account endpoint.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I verify that a Donor Account request is legitimate?">
        DAFpay verifies the ownership of the user's email address. If this email address matches the email address in the grantmaker's external system, a grantmaker can contact the donor to confirm the donor wants to link their DAF account to DAFpay.

        If the donor confirms, a reference between the external account and the Donor Account can be made using the `external_account_reference` field when updating the Donor Account.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What happens if a Donor Account request is rejected?">
        The DAFpay user will receive a notification with the rejection reason and instructions on what steps they can take to rectify the issue. For example, the donor might need to verify a different email with DAFpay before the Donor Account can be verified.

        You can provide a rejection reason when updating the Donor Account status to `rejected`.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Grant Requests

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Can a donor submit a grant request above the donor's balance?">
        Each Donor Account can have an optional limit, which will restrict the donor from submitting requests above the limit. DAFpay also ensures that the donor doesn't submit grant requests below the DAF's minimum.

        You can set a `limit` when creating or updating a Donor Account to control the maximum grant request amount.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I mark a Grant Request as submitted or rejected?">
        A Grant Request can be marked as `submitted`, which means that the grant request is in the grantmaker's external system, either via the [Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/update) or the Chariot Dashboard.

        Use the Update Grant Request endpoint to change the status to `submitted` or `rejected` as needed.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What happens if the Grant Request is rejected?">
        The DAFpay user will receive a notification with the rejection reason and instructions on what steps they can take to rectify the issue.

        When rejecting a grant request, you can provide a `rejection_reason` that will be communicated to the donor.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I receive notifications about new Grant Requests?">
        You can set up [webhook subscriptions](/api/webhooks) to automatically receive notifications when grant requests are created or updated. This allows you to process grant requests in real-time within your external system.

        Alternatively, you can poll the [List Grant Requests](/api/grant-requests/list) endpoint to check for new grant requests.
    </Accordion>
