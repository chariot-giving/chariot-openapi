As a grantmaker, you have the ability to create **Donor Accounts** for DAFpay. These Donor Accounts can reference a donor's account in your system, enabling seamless grant request processing and management.

## What are Donor Accounts?

Donor Accounts are the bridge between your grantmaker system and DAFpay. Each Donor Account:

- **References a donor's account** in your grantmaker system
- **Enables grant requests** from donors via DAFpay
- **Provides visibility** into all grant requests submitted by that donor within DAFpay
- **Supports automated processing** through webhooks and API integrations

## How Donor Accounts Work

Donor Accounts are created when a donor uses DAFpay for the first time. When a donor selects their DAF provider and creates their DAFpay account, a Donor Account request is automatically created for your grantmaker with a `PENDING` status.

You can then:
- **Approve** the Donor Account via the [Approve Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/approve) or the Chariot Dashboard, linking it to an account in your system
- **Reject** the Donor Account via the [Reject Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/reject) if it doesn't match your records
- **Close** an approved Donor Account via the [Close Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/close) if needed

Once a Donor Account is approved, donors can submit grant requests through DAFpay, which will be visible in Chariot for processing.

<Note>
When you approve a grant request, it's still your responsibility to enter the details of the grant request into your own system. The Grant Request API provides visibility into grant requests submitted through DAFpay, but you must process them in your grantmaker system.
