## What are Donor Accounts?

Donor Accounts are the bridge between your grantmaker system and DAFpay. Each Donor Account:

- **References a donor's account** in your grantmaker system
- **Enables grant requests** from donors via DAFpay
- **Provides visibility** into all grant requests submitted by that donor within DAFpay
- **Supports automated processing** through webhooks and API integrations

## How Donor Accounts Work

Donor Accounts are created when a donor uses DAFpay for the first time. When a donor selects their DAF provider and creates their DAFpay account, a Donor Account request is automatically created for your grantmaker with a `PENDING` status.

You can then:
- **Approve** the Donor Account via the [Approve Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/approve) or the Chariot Dashboard, linking it to an account in your system
- **Reject** the Donor Account via the [Reject Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/reject) if it doesn't match your records
- **Close** an approved Donor Account via the [Close Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/close) if needed

Once a Donor Account is approved, donors can submit grant requests through DAFpay. These grant requests are created in Chariot's system and can be retrieved via the Grant Request API or Chariot Dashboard.

<Note>
Grant requests are created in Chariot when donors submit them through DAFpay. Retrieve them from Chariot, submit to your grantmaker system, then update the status to `SUBMITTED` using the [Approve Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/approve).
