As a grantmaker, you have the ability to create **Donor Accounts** for DAFpay. These Donor Accounts can reference a donor's account in your external system, enabling seamless grant request processing and management.

## What are Donor Accounts?

Donor Accounts are the bridge between your grantmaker system and DAFpay. Each Donor Account:

- **References a donor's account** in your external grantmaker system
- **Enables grant requests** from donors via DAFpay
- **Provides visibility** into all grant requests submitted by that donor
- **Supports automated processing** through webhooks and API integrations

## How Donor Accounts Work

Donor Accounts can be created in two ways:

1. **Grantmaker-initiated**: You create a Donor Account directly via the [Donor Account API](/api/donor-accounts/create) or the Chariot Dashboard
2. **Donor-initiated**: When a donor uses DAFpay for the first time, they automatically create a Donor Account request that you can approve

Once a Donor Account is created and approved, donors can submit grant requests through DAFpay, which will be visible in your system for processing.
