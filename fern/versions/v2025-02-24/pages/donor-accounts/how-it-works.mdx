## Creating Donor Accounts

You can create Donor Accounts through two methods:

### Method 1: Create via API or Dashboard

Create a Donor Account directly and link it to a donor's account in your external system:

<Steps>

### Create a Donor Account

Use the [Create Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/create) endpoint to create a new Donor Account:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/donor_accounts" />

The Donor Account will be created in an `active` state, ready to receive grant requests from the donor.

### Link to External Account

When creating the Donor Account, you can specify an `external_account_reference` that links to the donor's account in your external system. This ensures grant requests are properly attributed.

</Steps>

### Method 2: Approve Donor Requests

When a donor uses DAFpay for the first time, they automatically create a Donor Account request:

<Steps>

### Donor Initiates Request

When a donor selects their DAF provider and creates their DAFpay account, a Donor Account request is automatically created for your grantmaker.

### Review the Request

View pending Donor Account requests via the [List Donor Accounts](/api/donor-accounts/list) endpoint with `status=pending`, or in the Chariot Dashboard.

### Approve or Reject

Approve the request using the [Update Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/update) endpoint to set the status to `active`, or reject it with a reason.

</Steps>

## Processing Grant Requests

Once a Donor Account is active, donors can submit grant requests through DAFpay:

<Steps>

### Donor Submits Grant Request

The donor uses DAFpay to submit a grant request to their Donor Account. DAFpay validates the request amount against the donor's balance and any account limits.

### Grant Request Appears in Your System

The grant request becomes visible via:
- The [Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/list) endpoints
- The Chariot Dashboard
- [Grant Request webhooks](/api/webhooks) (if configured)

### Process the Grant Request

Mark the grant request as `submitted` when it's been processed in your external system, or `rejected` if it cannot be processed.

</Steps>

<Tip>
Set up [webhook subscriptions](/api/webhooks) to automatically receive notifications when grant requests are created, allowing you to process them in real-time within your external system.
