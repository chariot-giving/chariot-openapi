## Managing Donor Accounts

Donor Accounts are automatically created when a donor uses DAFpay for the first time. You can then manage them through the API or Dashboard:

<Steps>

### Donor Initiates Request

When a donor selects their DAF provider and creates their DAFpay account, a Donor Account request is automatically created for your grantmaker with a `PENDING` status.

### Review the Request

View pending Donor Account requests via the [List Donor Accounts](/api/donor-accounts/list) endpoint with `status=PENDING`, or in the Chariot Dashboard.

### Approve the Donor Account

Approve the request using the [Approve Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/approve) endpoint. When approving, you can link it to an account in your system by providing an `account_identifier` and optional `account_name`:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/donor_accounts/{id}/approve" />

This sets the Donor Account status to `APPROVED` and links it to your system.

### Reject or Close (if needed)

If the Donor Account doesn't match your records, you can reject it using the [Reject Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/reject) endpoint with an optional rejection reason.

If you need to close an approved Donor Account, use the [Close Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/close) endpoint.

</Steps>

## Processing Grant Requests

Once a Donor Account is active, donors can submit grant requests through DAFpay:

<Steps>

### Donor Submits Grant Request

The donor uses DAFpay to submit a grant request to their Donor Account. DAFpay validates the request amount against the DAF's minimum grant amount and any Donor Account limits. The grant request is created in Chariot's system.

### Retrieve Grant Request from Chariot

The grant request created in Chariot's system can be retrieved via:
- The Chariot Dashboard
- The [Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/list) endpoints. You can also listen to [Grant Request webhooks](/api/webhooks) to automatically receive notifications when grant requests are created in Chariot.

### Submit Grant Request to Your System

Retrieve the grant request details from Chariot and submit them into your grantmaker system. Once the grant request has been successfully submitted to your grantmaker system, update its status to `SUBMITTED` using the [Approve Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/approve). If the grant request cannot be processed, reject it using the [Reject Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/reject).

<Note>
Grant requests are created in Chariot when donors submit them through DAFpay. Retrieve them from Chariot, submit to your grantmaker system, then update the status to `SUBMITTED` using the Approve Grant Request API. You are responsible for processing grant requests in your grantmaker system.
</Note>

</Steps>

<Tip>
Set up [webhook subscriptions](/api/webhooks) to automatically receive notifications when grant requests are created in Chariot's system, allowing you to retrieve and submit them to your grantmaker system in real-time.
