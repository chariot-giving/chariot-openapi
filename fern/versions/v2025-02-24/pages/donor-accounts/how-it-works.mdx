## Managing Donor Accounts

Donor Accounts are automatically created when a donor uses DAFpay for the first time. You can then manage them through the API or Dashboard:

<Steps>

### Donor Initiates Request

When a donor selects their DAF provider and creates their DAFpay account, a Donor Account request is automatically created for your grantmaker with a `PENDING` status.

### Review the Request

View pending Donor Account requests via the [List Donor Accounts](/api/donor-accounts/list) endpoint with `status=PENDING`, or in the Chariot Dashboard.

### Approve the Donor Account

Approve the request using the [Approve Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/approve) endpoint. When approving, you can link it to an account in your system by providing an `account_identifier` and optional `account_name`:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/donor_accounts/{id}/approve" />

This sets the Donor Account status to `APPROVED` and links it to your system.

### Reject or Close (if needed)

If the Donor Account doesn't match your records, you can reject it using the [Reject Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/reject) endpoint with an optional rejection reason.

If you need to close an approved Donor Account, use the [Close Donor Account](/api/donor-accounts/close) endpoint.

</Steps>

## Processing Grant Requests

Once a Donor Account is active, donors can submit grant requests through DAFpay:

<Steps>

### Donor Submits Grant Request

The donor uses DAFpay to submit a grant request to their Donor Account. DAFpay validates the request amount against the DAF's minimum grant amount and any Donor Account limits.

### Grant Request Appears in Your System

The grant request becomes visible via:
- The Chariot Dashboard
- The [Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/list) endpoints. You can also listen to [Grant Request webhooks](/api/webhooks) to automatically process grant requests within your grantmaker system.

### Process the Grant Request

Approve the grant request using the [Approve Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/approve) when it's been entered into your system, or reject it using the [Reject Grant Request API](/api/grant-requests/reject) if it cannot be processed.

<Note>
When you approve a grant request, it's still your responsibility to enter the details of the grant request into your own system. The Grant Request API provides visibility into grant requests submitted through DAFpay, but you must process them in your grantmaker system.
</Note>

</Steps>

<Tip>
Set up [webhook subscriptions](/api/webhooks) to automatically receive notifications when grant requests are created, allowing you to process them in real-time within your system.
