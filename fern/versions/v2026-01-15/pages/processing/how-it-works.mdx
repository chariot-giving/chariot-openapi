After you are approved and verified, you'll be given access to a dashboard where you will be able to manage and create `API Keys`, set up Payment Sources, and view all incoming donations.

## Understanding the Flow

Chariot enables nonprofits to unify and streamline the processing of offline gifts from multiple sources including Donor-Advised Funds, fundraising platforms, and physical mail. Here's how it works:

<Steps>

### Payment Sources are Created

Payment Sources represent segregated addresses for incoming deposits. These can be:
- **Electronic bank addresses** (unique account + routing numbers) for ACH transfers
- **Physical mailing addresses** (lockboxes) for processing checks and physical mail

Each Payment Source acts as a gateway for money to flow into your Financial Account while maintaining the source information needed for reconciliation.

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/payment_sources" />

### Deposits are Received

When a payment arrives at a Payment Source, Chariot creates a `Deposit` record. A Deposit represents a transfer of money that may contain one or more charitable donations.

Deposits can come through different payment rails:
- **Account transfers** - Instant transfers from other Chariot accounts
- **ACH transfers** - Electronic transfers from external sources
- **Check deposits** - Physical checks processed through lockboxes

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/deposits" />

### Donations are Processed

Chariot automatically attaches donation data to each deposit record, creating a complete audit trail. Each Deposit contains one or more `Donation` records that capture the complete gift information including:
- Donor attribution (name, email, DAF account)
- Gift amounts (gross, net, fees)
- Purpose and notes
- Corporate match information
- Platform details
- Custom properties for your CRM integration

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations" />

### Data is Unified and Reconciled

All donations from every source flow into a single unified system where you can:
- View consolidated gift data across all DAFs and platforms
- Export to your CRM or accounting system
- Track settlement and reconcile against bank deposits
- Manage custom properties for seamless data integration

</Steps>

## Processing for Different Gift Types

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="DAF Grants">
        When a donor makes a grant from their Donor-Advised Fund:

        1. The DAF sponsor sends funds to your designated Payment Source
        2. Chariot creates a Deposit and Donation with full donor attribution
        3. The donation includes DAF account details, donor information, and any fees
        4. You can reconcile the gift against the bank settlement in your dashboard

        Chariot supports grants from all major DAF sponsors including Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable, and grantmaker platforms like PayPal Grant Payments.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Physical Checks">
        When receiving physical check donations:

        1. Checks are mailed to your dedicated lockbox address
        2. Chariot's processing partner captures check images and details
        3. Funds are automatically deposited to your Chariot Deposit Account
        4. Donation records are created with check metadata and attached grant letters

        This modernizes your check processing while maintaining donor relationships.
