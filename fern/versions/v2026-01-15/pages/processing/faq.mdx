## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What is Chariot Processing?">
        Chariot Processing is a unified platform that enables nonprofits to streamline the processing of offline donations from multiple sources including Donor-Advised Funds, fundraising platforms, and physical checks.

        Instead of managing separate portals, banking connections, and reconciliation processes for each payment source, Chariot provides a single unified API and dashboard to process all your offline gifts.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Who is Chariot Processing for?">
        Chariot Processing is designed for nonprofit organizations that:
        - Receive donations from multiple Donor-Advised Fund sponsors
        - Use multiple fundraising platforms
        - Process physical checks from donors
        - Want to unify gift data from disparate sources
        - Need to integrate donation data with their CRM or accounting systems
        - Want to reduce manual reconciliation work

        Organizations of all sizes can benefit, from small local nonprofits to large national organizations.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How is this different from DAFpay?">
        **DAFpay** is a donor-facing checkout solution that enables individual donors to make grants from their Donor-Advised Funds at the point of online donation.

        **Chariot Processing** is a nonprofit-facing backend solution that unifies the processing of all offline donations after they've been initiated.

        Many nonprofits use both:
        - DAFpay for online donor checkout
        - Processing for unifying all offline gift data from DAFpay and other sources
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What does the onboarding process look like?">
        The onboarding process for nonprofits is as follows:

        <Steps>
            Create a Chariot account and provide your organization's EIN

            Complete nonprofit verification including IRS determination letter and authorized signer identification

            Provide banking information for settlements to your external bank account

            Set up Payment Sources for each payment source (DAFs, platforms, lockboxes)

            Share your Chariot banking details with your payment sources

            Start receiving donations automatically
        </Steps>

        The verification process typically takes 1-2 business days.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What are the fees for Chariot Processing?">
        Chariot Processing fees vary based on your organization's donation volume and specific needs. Contact [sales@givechariot.com](mailto:sales@givechariot.com) for pricing information.

        There are no fees for receiving donations from Chariot-enabled grantmakers using Chariot Disbursements.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Payment Sources

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What is a Payment Source?">
        A Payment Source is a segregated address for receiving donations from a specific source. Payment Sources can be:

        **Electronic (Connected Account)**
        - Unique routing number and account number
        - Used for receiving ACH transfers
        - Examples: Dedicated accounts for each DAF sponsor, fundraising platforms

        **Physical (Lockbox)**
        - Dedicated mailing address
        - Used for processing physical checks
        - Examples: PO Box for direct mail campaigns

        All Payment Sources deposit to your same Financial Account, but they maintain separate tracking for reconciliation.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How many Payment Sources can I create?">
        There's no hard limit on the number of Payment Sources you can create. Most nonprofits create:

        - One Payment Source per major DAF sponsor (Fidelity, Schwab, etc.)
        - One Payment Source per fundraising platform
        - One or more Lockbox Payment Sources for checks
        - One general-purpose Payment Source for other sources

        A typical mid-size nonprofit might have 10-20 Payment Sources.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I change which Payment Source a payment source uses?">
        Yes. Simply update the banking information with your payment source to point to a different Payment Source's routing and account number.

        Historical donations will remain associated with the original Payment Source for accurate record-keeping.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I delete a Payment Source?">
        Payment Sources cannot be deleted if they have historical deposits or donations. This preserves your audit trail and reconciliation history.

        If you no longer want to use a Payment Source, you can stop directing payment sources to it and it will become inactive over time.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Donations and Deposits

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What's the difference between a Donation and a Deposit?">
        **Deposit**: A transfer of money that arrives at a Payment Source. One deposit may contain multiple donations.

        **Donation**: An individual charitable gift from a donor. Multiple donations can be included in a single deposit.

        Example: A fundraising platform sends you a weekly ACH payout of $10,000 containing 50 individual donations. This would be:
        - 1 Deposit for $10,000
        - 50 Donations with individual donor attribution
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How is donor information captured?">
        Donor attribution depends on the payment source:

        **DAF Grants**: Includes DAF account holder name, email, DAF account ID, and message from donor

        **Platform Donations**: Includes donor name, email, donation amount, platform fees, and any donor messages

        **Checks**: Includes check payer information, check number, check amount, and images of the physical check

        All donations include the gross amount, net amount, fees deducted, and the effective date of the donation.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I update donation information after it's created?">
        Yes. Use the [Update Donation](/api/donations/update) endpoint to update:
        - Purpose (how the donor intended the gift to be used)
        - Note (additional information about the donation)
        - Attribution (donor information)

        You cannot update the amounts or fees as these reflect the actual transaction that occurred.

        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="PATCH /v1/donations/{id}" />
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I add custom fields to donations?">
        Use the Properties API to assign custom properties to donations:

        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/properties/donation/{donation_id}/assign" />

        This enables you to:
        - Map to your CRM's custom fields
        - Track internal campaign codes
        - Add processing notes
        - Maintain your own metadata

        Properties are indexed and searchable, making it easy to filter and report on donations with specific property values.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How long does it take for donations to appear in Chariot?">
        **In-Network Donations** (from Chariot Disbursements): Instant - donations appear immediately

        **ACH Transfers**: 1-2 business days from when the payment source initiates the transfer

        **Checks**: 1-3 business days from when the check arrives at the lockbox (deposit to your account takes an additional 3-5 business days)

        Donation data is available via API as soon as Chariot receives the transfer, even before funds have fully settled.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration and API

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How do I integrate Chariot with my CRM?">
        The typical integration flow:

        1. **Subscribe to webhooks** for `donation.created` events
        2. **Receive webhook** when a new donation is created
        3. **Retrieve donation details** via the API
        4. **Map fields** to your CRM's data model
        5. **Create or update** constituent records in your CRM
        6. **Assign properties** back to the Chariot donation for two-way sync

        Many nonprofits build this integration themselves or work with their CRM consultant to set it up.

        Chariot also offers pre-built integrations for popular CRM systems. Contact [support@givechariot.com](mailto:support@givechariot.com) to learn more.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I bulk import historical donations?">
        For new customers migrating to Chariot, we offer data import services to backfill historical donation records. This ensures complete reporting continuity.

        Contact [support@givechariot.com](mailto:support@givechariot.com) to discuss your historical data import needs.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I handle duplicate donations?">
        Chariot automatically de-duplicates donations based on unique identifiers provided by the payment source.

        If you encounter a suspected duplicate:
        1. Check the donation's `artifacts` array for source files
        2. Compare effective dates and amounts
        3. If truly duplicate, mark one with a property to exclude from reporting
        4. Contact support if you need assistance identifying duplicates

        For DAF grants, Chariot uses the DAF sponsor's grant ID to ensure each grant is only recorded once.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What happens if a deposit fails or is returned?">
        If a deposit is returned (e.g., an ACH transfer is rejected):

        1. The Deposit status changes to `failed`
        2. The associated Donations remain in your system
        3. A `deposit.returned` webhook is sent
        4. Funds are debited from your account if they had settled

        You should:
        - Review the returned deposit and reason
        - Contact the payment source to resolve the issue
        - Update your systems to reflect the failed deposit

        Contact [support@givechariot.com](mailto:support@givechariot.com) if you need help resolving returned deposits.
    </Accordion>
