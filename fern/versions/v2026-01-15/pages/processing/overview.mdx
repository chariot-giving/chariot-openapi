## The Problem

> Most nonprofits receive donations from **multiple sources** - Donor-Advised Funds, fundraising platforms, direct mail checks - each with their own portal, payment method, and data format.

> Nonprofits spend countless hours **manually reconciling** payments across different systems, logging into dozens of portals, downloading CSV files, and matching donations to bank deposits.

> Donor data is **fragmented and incomplete** across these systems, making it difficult to maintain accurate constituent records and generate proper acknowledgment letters.

> Integration with CRM and accounting systems requires **custom work for each payment source**, creating a maintenance nightmare and data quality issues.

> **It doesn't have to be this way.**

## A New Approach

What if you could?

- Receive donations from all sources through a single unified platform
- Automatically reconcile payments with complete donor attribution
- Access rich donation data via a single API
- Seamlessly integrate with your existing CRM, ERP, and accounting systems
- Process checks, ACH transfers, and in-network payments in one place
- Eliminate manual data entry and reconciliation work

That's what Chariot Processing does.

## How It Works

Chariot Processing provides **Payment Sources** - segregated addresses for receiving donations from different sources. These can be electronic bank addresses (account + routing numbers) or physical mailing addresses (lockboxes).

When donations arrive at a Payment Source, Chariot automatically:
1. **Captures** the payment and creates a Deposit record
2. **Parses** individual donations with complete donor attribution
3. **Settles** funds to your Chariot Financial Account
4. **Provides** unified access via API and dashboard

You get complete donation data including:
- Donor name, email, and contact information
- Gift amounts (gross, net, and fees)
- DAF account details and grant letters
- Platform information and transaction IDs
- Corporate match information
- Custom properties for downstream CRM and accounting systems integration

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Payment Sources">
        Payment Sources are segregated addresses for receiving donations. Think of them as different "doors" into your Financial Account.

        - **Electronic Payment Sources**: Unique routing + account numbers for ACH transfers
        - **Lockbox Payment Sources**: Physical mailing addresses for check processing

        Each Payment Source can be dedicated to a specific source (e.g., one for Fidelity Charitable, one for PayPal Giving Fund) making reconciliation seamless.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Deposits">
        A Deposit represents a transfer of money to a Payment Source. One deposit may contain multiple individual donations.

        Deposits track:
        - Total amount transferred
        - Settlement status (pending, complete, failed)
        - Which Payment Source received it
        - Payment method (ACH, check, account transfer)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Donations">
        A Donation is an individual charitable gift from a donor. Donations include complete attribution and metadata.

        Each donation captures:
        - Donor information (name, email, address)
        - Gift amounts (gross, net, fees)
        - Purpose and donor notes
        - DAF account details (if applicable)
        - Platform information (if applicable)
        - Corporate match details (if applicable)
    </Accordion>
