## The Problem

> Nonprofits receive donations from **multiple sources** - Donor-Advised Funds, workplace giving, crowdfunding platforms, mailed checks - each with their own portal, payment method, and data format.

> Nonprofits spend countless hours **manually reconciling** payments across different systems, logging into dozens of portals, downloading CSV files, and matching donations to bank deposits.

> Donor data is **fragmented and inconsistent** across these systems, making it difficult to maintain accurate constituent records and generate proper acknowledgment letters.

> Getting donations into your CRM and accounting systems requires **custom work for each payment source**, creating a maintenance nightmare and data quality issues.

And, the problem is only getting worse as more payment sources emerge - creating a never-ending game of gift processing wack-a-mole.

> **It doesn't have to be this way.**

## A New Approach

What if you could?

- Receive donations from all sources through a single unified platform
- Enrich donation data with complete donor attribution, campaign codes, appeal codes, fund codes, and more.
- Seamlessly integrate with your existing CRM and accounting systems
- Eliminate hours of manual data entry and reconciliation work

That's what Chariot does.

## How It Works

Chariot provides **Payment Sources** - segregated addresses for receiving donations from different sources. These can be electronic bank addresses (account + routing numbers) or physical mailing addresses (lockboxes).

When donations arrive at a Payment Source, Chariot automatically:
1. **Captures** the payment and creates a Deposit record
2. **Attaches** donation data to the deposit

You get complete donation data from the source including:
- Donor name, email, and contact information
- Gift amounts (gross, net, and fees)
- DAF account details and grant letters
- Platform information and platform fees
- Corporate match information

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Payment Sources">
        Payment Sources are segregated addresses for receiving donations. Think of them as different "doors" into your Financial Account.

        - **Electronic Payment Sources**: Unique routing + account numbers for ACH transfers
        - **Lockbox Payment Sources**: Physical mailing addresses for check processing

        Each Payment Source can be dedicated to a specific source (e.g., one for Fidelity Charitable, one for PayPal Giving Fund) making reconciliation seamless.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Deposits">
        A Deposit represents a transfer of money to a Payment Source. One deposit may contain multiple individual donations.

        Deposits track:
        - Total amount transferred
        - Settlement status (pending, complete, failed)
        - Which Payment Source received it
        - Payment method (ACH, check, account transfer)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Donations">
        A Donation is an individual charitable gift from a donor. Donations include complete attribution and metadata.

        Each donation captures:
        - Donor information (name, email, address)
        - Gift amounts (gross, net, fees)
        - Purpose and donor notes
        - DAF account details (if applicable)
        - Platform information (if applicable)
        - Corporate match details (if applicable)
    </Accordion>
