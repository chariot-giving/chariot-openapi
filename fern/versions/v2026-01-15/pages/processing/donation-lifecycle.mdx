## Deposit Lifecycle

A Deposit represents a transfer of money to your Financial Account via a Payment Source. Understanding the deposit lifecycle helps you know when funds are available and how to handle edge cases.

### Deposit Status Flow

    A[pending] --> B[complete]
    A --> C[failed]
    B --> C
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | The deposit has been received but funds have not yet settled |
| `complete` | The deposit has successfully settled to your Chariot Deposit Account |
| `failed` | The deposit was returned or rejected (funds will be debited if previously settled) |

### Status Details

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Pending">
        When a deposit is first created, it enters the `pending` state.

        **What this means:**
        - Chariot has received notification of the incoming transfer
        - Individual donation records have been created or will be created shortly
        - Funds have not yet settled to your account
        - You should not yet disburse these funds

        **How long it lasts:**
        - **In-Network transfers**: < 1 second (almost instant)
        - **ACH transfers**: 1-2 business days
        - **Check deposits**: 5-7 business days

        **What you should do:**
        - Donation data is available for CRM sync
        - Wait for `deposit.completed` webhook before considering funds available
        - Do not create acknowledgment letters yet (in case deposit fails)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Complete">
        When a deposit reaches `complete` status, funds have successfully settled to your account.

        **What this means:**
        - Funds are available in your Chariot Deposit Account balance
        - You can transfer funds to your external bank account
        - Donations are finalized and ready for acknowledgment
        - The deposit won't be reversed (except in rare fraud cases)

        **What you should do:**
        - Send donor acknowledgment letters
        - Finalize CRM records
        - Reconcile with your accounting system
        - Consider transferring funds to your external account

        **Webhook event:** `deposit.completed`
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Failed">
        A deposit can fail for several reasons, even after initially settling.

        **Common failure reasons:**
        - ACH transfer rejected by bank
        - Insufficient funds at source
        - Incorrect account information
        - Check bounced or returned

        **What this means:**
        - If funds had settled, they will be debited from your account
        - Donations remain in your system but should be marked as uncollected
        - You should not send acknowledgment letters
        - You may need to contact the payment source

        **What you should do:**
        - Review the failure reason in the deposit details
        - Contact the payment source to resolve the issue
        - If you sent an acknowledgment, follow up with donor
        - Mark donations in your CRM as pending resolution

        **Webhook event:** `deposit.returned`
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Donation Lifecycle

Donations represent individual gifts from donors. Unlike deposits, donations don't have a status field but their availability follows the deposit lifecycle.

### Donation Creation

Donations are created when:
1. A deposit is received at a Payment Source
2. The payment source provides donation-level details
3. Chariot parses and attributes individual gifts

**Timing:**
- Donations are created at the same time as the deposit
- You can retrieve donation data immediately via API
- Donation data is available even while the deposit is still pending

### Donation Data Structure

Each donation includes:
