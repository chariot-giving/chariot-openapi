## Electronic Donations (ACH)

The flow of funds for electronic donations follows these steps:

<Frame>
    <img src='../../images/flow-of-funds-nonprofit.png' />
</Frame>

1. **Payment Source**: A DAF sponsor or fundraising platform initiates an ACH transfer to your Payment Source
2. **Payment Source Receipt**: Chariot receives the transfer at your designated Payment Source's routing and account number
3. **Deposit Creation**: Chariot creates a Deposit record tracking the incoming transfer to your Financial Account
4. **Donation Processing**: Individual donations within the deposit are parsed and attributed with donor information
5. **Settlement**: Funds are settled to your Chariot Deposit Account<span title="Chariot is a financial technology company, not a bank. Chariot Accounts come with a Demand Deposit Account through our banking services partner, Column N.A., Member FDIC. Deposits in Chariot Accounts are eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor, for each insurable capacity in which the account is held."><sup><Icon icon="fa-regular fa-circle-info" size="2.5"/></sup></span>
6. **Data Available**: Complete donation data is available via API for reconciliation and CRM integration
7. **Transfer Out**: You can transfer funds to your external bank account as needed

### Timeline for ACH Transfers

- **Day 1-2**: Transfer settles to your Chariot account

<Note>
ACH transfer timing depends on when the payment source initiates the transfer and standard ACH settlement windows.

3. **Image Capture**: Check images and metadata are captured
4. **Deposit Creation**: Chariot creates a deposit and initiates check deposit to your account

7. **Data Available**: Donation data with check images available via API

### Timeline for Check Processing

</Warning>

## Fund Segregation by Source

Payment Sources enable you to segregate and track donations by source while maintaining a single Financial Account:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 Chariot Deposit Account                      │
│                    (One unified balance)                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ▲
                              │
        ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
        │                     │                     │
┌───────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐
│Payment Source │    │Payment Source  │    │Payment Source │
│   Fidelity    │    │     Schwab     │    │   Direct Mail │
│  Charitable   │    │   Charitable   │    │    Lockbox    │
└───────────────┘    └────────────────┘    └───────────────┘
```

Each Payment Source:
- Has its own unique routing + account numbers or mailing address
- Tracks deposits and donations separately for reconciliation
- Settles to the same underlying Financial Account
- Maintains complete audit trail of source and attribution

This approach provides:
- **Easy reconciliation** - Match deposits to payment sources automatically
- **Source tracking** - Know which DAF or platform each donation came from
- **Unified management** - One account balance, multiple funding sources
- **Flexible reporting** - Report by source, by date range, or in aggregate

## Reconciliation Flow

Here's how to reconcile donations with your systems:

<Steps>

### Check Your Financial Account Balance

Verify your current available balance:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/financial_accounts/balance" />

### List Recent Deposits

See which deposits have settled:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/deposits" />

### Get Donations for Each Deposit

Retrieve the individual donations within a deposit:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations" />

Filter by `deposit_id` to see all donations in a specific deposit.

### Match to Your Records

Use the donation data to:
- Update your CRM with donor information
- Generate acknowledgment letters
- Reconcile with your accounting system
- Create internal reports by source or campaign

</Steps>

## Transferring Funds Out

When you're ready to move funds to your external bank account:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/outbound_transfers" />

<Info>
You must configure and verify an external bank account through the Chariot Dashboard before you can create outbound transfers in production.
</Info>

### Outbound Transfer Timeline

- **Day 0**: Create outbound transfer via API or dashboard
- **Day 2-3**: Funds arrive in your external bank account
