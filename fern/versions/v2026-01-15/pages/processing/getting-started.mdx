- Authorized officer or director to complete onboarding

## Step 1: Create Your Chariot Account

<Steps>

Visit [givechariot.com](https://givechariot.com) and click "Get Started" to create your nonprofit account.

You'll need to provide:
- Organization name and EIN

</Note>

### Access Your Dashboard

Once approved, you'll receive access to your Chariot Dashboard where you can:
- View all incoming donations
- Manage Payment Sources
- Generate and manage API keys
- Export data to your systems

</Steps>

## Step 2: Set Up Payment Sources

Payment Sources are the foundation of Chariot Processing. They provide segregated addresses (electronic or physical) for receiving donations from different sources.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Electronic Payment Sources">
        Electronic Payment Sources provide unique bank account and routing numbers for receiving ACH transfers.

        **Use cases:**
        - Dedicated account for Fidelity Charitable grants
        - Dedicated account for PayPal Giving Fund distributions
        - Dedicated account for workplace giving platforms, e.g. Benevity

        **How to set up:**

        1. Log into your Chariot Dashboard
        2. Navigate to "Payment Sources"
        3. Click "Create Payment Source"
        4. Select "Connected Account" as the type
        5. Name it (e.g., "Fidelity Charitable DAF")
        6. Save to receive your unique account and routing numbers and your payment source ID

        Share these banking details with your DAF sponsor or platform to start receiving donations.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Lockbox Payment Sources">
        Lockbox Payment Sources provide physical mailing addresses for processing checks and physical mail.

        **Use cases:**
        - Dedicated PO Box for direct mail campaigns
        - Dedicated address for major DAF sponsors that mail checks
        - Consolidated check processing from multiple sources

        **How to set up:**

        1. Contact Chariot support to enable lockbox services
        2. Chariot will provision a dedicated mailing address
        3. Configure processing rules (endorsement, deposit preferences)
        4. Update your donor communications with the new address

        Checks mailed to your lockbox are automatically deposited and the donation data is captured in Chariot.

        <Note>
        Lockbox services may incur additional fees. Contact [support@givechariot.com](mailto:support@givechariot.com) for pricing.
        </Note>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Configure Your First Payment Source

Now that you have Payment Sources, you can start directing external platforms and grantmakers to use them.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="DAF Sponsors">
        ### Setting Up DAF Payment Processing

        For each major DAF sponsor (Fidelity, Schwab, etc.):

        1. Create a dedicated Payment Source in your dashboard
        2. Contact the DAF sponsor's nonprofit support team
        3. Provide your Chariot banking details (account + routing number)
        4. Request they update your profile for electronic disbursements

        Once configured, all grants from that DAF will flow to your Payment Source with complete donor attribution.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Fundraising Platforms">
        ### Setting Up Platform Payment Processing

        For fundraising platforms that support custom payout accounts:

        1. Create a Payment Source for the platform
        2. Log into your platform account (e.g., PayPal Grant Payments)
        3. Navigate to payout or banking settings
        4. Update your banking information with Chariot Payment Source details
        5. Verify the connection with the platform

        Chariot automatically reconciles batch payouts and attributes individual donations.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Direct Mail">
        ### Setting Up Check Processing

        For processing physical checks:

        1. Request a Lockbox Payment Source from Chariot
        2. Update your donation reply cards with the lockbox address
        3. Update your website and donor communications
        4. Configure check processing rules in your dashboard

        Chariot processes checks, captures images, and creates donation records automatically.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Retrieve and Reconcile Donations

Once donations start flowing in, you can retrieve them via API and reconcile with your systems.

<Steps>

### List Recent Donations

Retrieve donations filtered by Payment Source, date range, or Deposit:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations" />

### Get Detailed Donation Information

Retrieve a specific donation with all attribution and metadata:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations/{id}" example="GetDonation" />

### View Settlement Details

Check which Deposits have settled in your account:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/deposits" />

### Export to Your CRM

Use the donations data to:
- Create constituent records in your CRM
- Update donor acknowledgment systems
- Reconcile with your accounting system
- Generate tax receipts

</Steps>

## Step 5: Configure Webhooks (Optional)

For real-time notification of new donations:

<Steps>

### Create an Event Subscription

Subscribe to donation events to receive webhooks:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/event_subscriptions" />

### Subscribe to Key Events

Important events for gift processing:
- `donation.created` - New donation received
- `donation.updated` - Donation details updated
- `deposit.completed` - Deposit settled to your account
- `deposit.returned` - Deposit was returned/rejected

### Process Webhooks

When you receive a webhook, you can:
- Automatically create CRM records
- Trigger thank you emails
- Update your accounting system
- Flag for manual review if needed

</Steps>

## Step 6: Customize with Properties

Use Properties to extend donation data with your own custom fields:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/properties/{resource_type}/{resource_id}/assign" />

This allows you to:
- Map to your CRM's custom fields
- Track internal campaign codes
- Add processing notes
- Maintain audit trails
