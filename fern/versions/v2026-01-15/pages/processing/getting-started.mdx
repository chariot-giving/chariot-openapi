This guide will walk you through setting up Chariot Processing to start receiving and processing offline donations from multiple sources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A verified 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
- EIN (Employer Identification Number)
- Banking information for settlement
- Authorized officer or director to complete onboarding

## Step 1: Create Your Chariot Account

<Steps>

### Sign Up

Visit [givechariot.com](https://givechariot.com) and click "Sign Up" to create your nonprofit account.

You'll need to provide:
- Organization name and EIN
- Contact information
- Your role at the organization

### Complete Verification

Chariot will verify your nonprofit status and collect additional information including:
- IRS determination letter
- Banking information for settlements
- Authorized signer identification

This verification process typically takes 1-2 business days.

<Note>
Chariot verifies nonprofit eligibility and authorized signers to ensure compliance with banking regulations and prevent fraud.
</Note>

### Access Your Dashboard

Once approved, you'll receive access to your Chariot Dashboard where you can:
- View all incoming donations
- Manage Virtual Accounts
- Generate and manage API keys
- Export data to your systems

</Steps>

## Step 2: Get Your Gift Processing Program

Every Chariot account comes with a default Gift Processing program. You can verify your program is enabled by calling the Programs API:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/programs" />

Your Gift Processing program should have `gift_processing_status: "enabled"`. This program manages all inbound donation revenue and reconciliation.

<Info>
Programs encapsulate functional operations and allow for segregation of funds & activity on top of a Financial Account. If you also need to make grant disbursements, Chariot can enable a Grantmaking program for your account.
</Info>

## Step 3: Set Up Virtual Accounts

Virtual Accounts are the foundation of Chariot Processing. They provide segregated addresses (electronic or physical) for receiving donations from different sources.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Electronic Virtual Accounts">
        Electronic Virtual Accounts provide unique bank account and routing numbers for receiving ACH transfers.

        **Use cases:**
        - Dedicated account for Fidelity Charitable grants
        - Dedicated account for PayPal Giving Fund distributions
        - Dedicated account for workplace giving platforms
        - Dedicated account for each major fundraising platform

        **How to set up:**

        1. Log into your Chariot Dashboard
        2. Navigate to "Virtual Accounts"
        3. Click "Create Virtual Account"
        4. Select "Connected Account" as the type
        5. Name it (e.g., "Fidelity Charitable DAF")
        6. Save to receive your unique account and routing numbers

        Share these banking details with your DAF sponsor or platform to start receiving donations.

        <EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/virtual_accounts" />
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Lockbox Virtual Accounts">
        Lockbox Virtual Accounts provide physical mailing addresses for processing checks and physical mail.

        **Use cases:**
        - Dedicated PO Box for direct mail campaigns
        - Dedicated address for major DAF sponsors that mail checks
        - Consolidated check processing from multiple sources

        **How to set up:**

        1. Contact Chariot support to enable lockbox services
        2. Chariot will provision a dedicated mailing address
        3. Configure processing rules (endorsement, deposit preferences)
        4. Update your donor communications with the new address

        Checks mailed to your lockbox are automatically deposited and the donation data is captured in Chariot.

        <Note>
        Lockbox services may incur additional fees. Contact [support@givechariot.com](mailto:support@givechariot.com) for pricing.
        </Note>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4: Configure Your First Payment Source

Now that you have Virtual Accounts, you can start directing payment sources to use them.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="DAF Sponsors">
        ### Setting Up DAF Payment Processing

        For each major DAF sponsor (Fidelity, Schwab, etc.):

        1. Create a dedicated Virtual Account in your dashboard
        2. Contact the DAF sponsor's nonprofit support team
        3. Provide your Chariot banking details (account + routing number)
        4. Request they update your profile for electronic disbursements

        **Example: Fidelity Charitable**

        - Call Fidelity Charitable at 1-800-952-4438
        - Request to update your banking information for ACH deposits
        - Provide your Chariot Virtual Account details
        - Verify the update in their nonprofit portal

        Once configured, all grants from that DAF will flow to your Virtual Account with complete donor attribution.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Fundraising Platforms">
        ### Setting Up Platform Payment Processing

        For fundraising platforms that support custom payout accounts:

        1. Create a Virtual Account for the platform
        2. Log into your platform account (e.g., GoFundMe, Classy)
        3. Navigate to payout or banking settings
        4. Update your banking information with Chariot Virtual Account details
        5. Verify the connection with a test payout

        Chariot automatically reconciles batch payouts and attributes individual donations.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Direct Mail">
        ### Setting Up Check Processing

        For processing physical checks:

        1. Request a Lockbox Virtual Account from Chariot
        2. Update your donation reply cards with the lockbox address
        3. Update your website and donor communications
        4. Configure check processing rules in your dashboard

        Chariot processes checks, captures images, and creates donation records automatically.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Retrieve and Reconcile Donations

Once donations start flowing in, you can retrieve them via API and reconcile with your systems.

<Steps>

### List Recent Donations

Retrieve donations filtered by Virtual Account, date range, or deposit:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations" />

### Get Detailed Donation Information

Retrieve a specific donation with all attribution and metadata:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations/{id}" example="GetDonation" />

### View Settlement Details

Check which deposits have settled in your account:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/deposits" />

### Export to Your CRM

Use the donations data to:
- Create constituent records in your CRM
- Update donor acknowledgment systems
- Reconcile with your accounting system
- Generate tax receipts

</Steps>

## Step 6: Configure Webhooks (Optional)

For real-time notification of new donations:

<Steps>

### Create an Event Subscription

Subscribe to donation events to receive webhooks:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/event_subscriptions" />

### Subscribe to Key Events

Important events for gift processing:
- `donation.created` - New donation received
- `donation.updated` - Donation details updated
- `deposit.completed` - Deposit settled to your account
- `deposit.returned` - Deposit was returned/rejected

### Process Webhooks

When you receive a webhook, you can:
- Automatically create CRM records
- Trigger thank you emails
- Update your accounting system
- Flag for manual review if needed

</Steps>

## Step 7: Customize with Properties

Use Properties to extend donation data with your own custom fields:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/properties/{resource_type}/{resource_id}/assign" />

This allows you to:
- Map to your CRM's custom fields
- Track internal campaign codes
- Add processing notes
- Maintain audit trails
