This guide will walk you through setting up Chariot to start receiving and processing offline donations from multiple sources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A verified 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
- EIN (Employer Identification Number)
- Authorized officer or director to complete onboarding

## Step 1: Create Your Chariot Account

<Steps>

### Sign Up

Visit [givechariot.com](https://givechariot.com) and click "Get Started" to create your nonprofit account.

You'll need to be a control person for the organization to claim the account.

### Complete Verification

Chariot will verify your nonprofit status and may collect additional information.

This verification process typically takes 3-10 business days.

<Note>
Chariot verifies nonprofit eligibility and control person identification to ensure compliance with banking regulations and prevent fraud.
</Note>

### Access Your Dashboard

Once approved, you'll receive access to your Chariot Dashboard where you can:
- View all incoming donations
- Manage Payment Sources
- Generate and manage API keys
- Export data to your systems

</Steps>

## Step 2: Set Up Payment Sources

Payment Sources provide segregated addresses (electronic or physical) for receiving donations from different sources.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Electronic Payment Sources">
        Electronic Payment Sources provide unique bank account and routing numbers for receiving ACH transfers.

        **Use cases:**
        - Dedicated payment source for Fidelity Charitable grants
        - Dedicated payment source for PayPal Giving Fund distributions
        - Dedicated payment source for workplace giving platforms, e.g. Benevity

        **How to set up:**

        1. Log into your Chariot Dashboard
        2. Navigate to "Payment Sources"
        3. Click on a Payment Source and follow the instructions to connect it.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Lockbox Payment Sources">
        Lockbox Payment Sources provide physical mailing addresses for processing checks and physical mail.

        **Use cases:**
        - Dedicated PO Box for direct mail campaigns
        - Dedicated address for major DAF sponsors that mail checks
        - Consolidated check processing from multiple sources

        **How to set up:**

        1. Contact Chariot support to enable lockbox services
        2. Chariot will provision a dedicated mailing address
        3. Configure processing rules (appeal codes, etc.)
        4. Update your portal and/or donor communications with the new address

        Checks mailed to your lockbox are automatically deposited and the donation data is captured in Chariot.

        <Note>
        Lockbox services may incur additional fees. Contact [support@givechariot.com](mailto:support@givechariot.com) for pricing.
        </Note>

</AccordionGroup>


## Step 3: Retrieve Donations

Once donations start flowing in, you can retrieve them via API.

<Steps>

### List Recent Donations

Retrieve donations filtered by Payment Source, date range, or Deposit:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations" />

### Get Detailed Donation Information

Retrieve a specific donation with all attribution and metadata:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="GET /v1/donations/{id}" example="GetDonation" />

### Sync data with your systems (CRM, accounting, etc.)

Use the donations data to:
- Create constituent records in your CRM
- Update donor acknowledgment systems
- Reconcile with your accounting system

You can also use Properties to extend donation data with your own custom fields:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/properties/{id}/assign" />

This allows you to:
- Map to your CRM's custom fields
- Track internal campaign codes
- Add processing notes
- Maintain audit trails

</Steps>

## Step 5: Configure Webhooks (Optional)

For real-time notification of new donations:

<Steps>

### Create an Event Subscription

Subscribe to donation events to receive webhooks:

<EndpointRequestSnippet endpoint="POST /v1/event_subscriptions" />

### Subscribe to Key Events

Important events for gift processing:
- `donation.created` - New donation received
- `donation.updated` - Donation details updated
- `deposit.completed` - Deposit settled to your account
- `deposit.returned` - Deposit was returned/rejected

### Process Webhooks

When you receive a webhook, you can:
- Automatically create CRM records
- Trigger thank you emails
- Update your accounting system
- Flag for manual review if needed

</Steps>
