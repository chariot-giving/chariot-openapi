## How it works

The initial step involves **registering** each nonprofit organization. Once registered, you will receive a Connect ID (CID) that can be used to **initialize** Connect, the web component that renders the DAFpay button.  Lastly, **query** Chariot's APIs to gather all the data generated through Connect.
