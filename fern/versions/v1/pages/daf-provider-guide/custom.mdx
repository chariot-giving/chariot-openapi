**Please follow steps 1 and 2 to enable a DAFpay custom adaptor for your portal.**

### Step 1: Partnership Agreement
Review and sign our the Standard Agreement to align on the steps we are taking to connect your DAF in DAFpay and the ways we work together.

### Step 2: Test Accounts
Provision two accounts for building and testing purposes

<Note title="Account 1">
**Funding**: Enough for ~10 test grants (will not actually be disbursed)
**Duration**: No expiration date
**User**: developers@givechariot.com
</Note>

<Note title="Account 2">
**Type**: Access to two or more funds within the same account
**Funding**: Enough for ~10 test grants (will not actually be disbursed)
**Duration**: No expiration date
**User**: neil@givechariot.com
</Note>

### Step 3: Custom Build
Chariot will build out the adaptor that enforces a minimum grant size across all DAFpay instances and accommodates any MFA required for log in within DAFpay.  

Chariot will test for full functionality in common “edge case” accounts like multiple funds or multiple fund types under a single login.

### Step 4: Integration Walkthrough
Chariot will do a live demo of the new adaptor with your team, so you can see how DAFpay grant requests appear in your queue for approval.

Once Chariot has addressed your questions and requests, we’ll release the new connection in Production. 

### Step 5: Ongoing Communication
In order to ensure a reliable DAFpay experience for your fundholders, please inform the Chariot team if there are any changes to your portal layout, login steps, etc. so we can update our adaptor. 

Please also share with us as soon as possible if any fundholder experiences an issue DAFpay so we can address it quickly.
