If your DAF does not have oAuth, we recommend the following steps that will allow the Chariot team to build out a DAFpay adaptor customized for your portal. 

## Step 1: Partnership Agreement
Review and sign our brief Standard Agreement to align on the steps we are taking to connect your DAF in DAFpay and the ways we work together.

##Step 2: Test Accounts
Provision two accounts for building and testing purposes

###Account #1
Funding: Enough for ~10 test grants (will not actually be disbursed)
Duration: No expiration date
User: developers@givechariot.com

###Account #2
Type: Access to two or more funds within the same account
Funding: Enough for ~10 test grants (will not actually be disbursed)
Duration: No expiration date
User: neil@givechariot.com

##Step 3: Custom Build

Chariot will build out the adaptor to ensure the following:
- Enforcing a minimum grant size across all DAFpay instances for your DAF.
- Accommodating any MFA required for log in within DAFpay.  
- Testing for full functionality in common “edge case” accounts like multiple funds or multiple fund types under a single login.

##Step 4: Integration Walkthrough
Chariot will do a live demo of the new adaptor with your team, so you can see how DAFpay grant requests appear in your queue for approval.
Once Chariot has addressed your questions and requests, we’ll release the new connection in Production. 

##Step 5:Ongoing Communication
In order to ensure a reliable DAFpay experience for your fundholders, please inform the Chariot team if there are any changes to your portal layout, login steps, etc. so we can update our adaptor. 
Please also share with us as soon as possible if any fundholder experiences an issue DAFpay so we can address it quickly.
