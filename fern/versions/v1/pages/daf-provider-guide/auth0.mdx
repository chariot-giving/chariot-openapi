## Auth0 Access Token Instructions
1. Setup a new Auth0 account or login to an existing Auth0 account
2. Configure Universal Login under Branding tab
3. Setup Auth0 API for your API endpoints
4. Create Auth0 Application (M2M app)
    1. Define application Allowed Callback URLs that are specific for Chariot. This allows OAuth callbacks to be sent to Chariot’s system after a user logs in to your application.
        1. Local - [http://localhost:8080/v1/callback](http://localhost:8080/callback)
        2. Staging - https://devapi.givechariot.com/v1/callback 
        3. Production - https://api.givechariot.com/v1/callback 
    2. Make a few decisions
        1. Choose an Authorization Flow (Grant Types) from Advanced Settings. We recommend Authorization Code Flow.
        2. Choose Token Endpoint Authentication Method. We suggest using default “Post” method.
        3. If you are using OIDC, ensure your application has OIDC discovery enabled (./well-known/openid-configuration endpoint)
    3. Give Chariot the necessary information about the M2M Auth0 application
        1. Issuer URL
        2. Client ID
        3. Client Secret
5. Give Chariot API Docs
