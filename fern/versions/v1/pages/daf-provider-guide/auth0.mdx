Chariot uses [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC) to facilitate access token transmission. OIDC is an authentication protocol commonly used by consumer-facing SSO implementations that is built on top of the industry standard OAuth 2.0 protocol.

### Checklist for the OAuth Provider

- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server (Okta, Auth0, or custom)
- OAuth 2.0 User Authorization Login Page (Universal Login for Okta/Auth0)
- OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Application for Chariot (we’ll need to register and configure Callback URLs for local, staging, and production environments).

### Required Information 

Please provide the following information needed for the integration:
1. `ISSUER_BASE_URL`: This is the URL for the Token issuer (identity provider)
2. `CLIENT_ID`: The unique identifier for the OAuth 2.0 client
3. `CLIENT_SECRET`: The unique secret for the same corresponding OAuth 2.0 client
4. DAF Provider API Endpoints and Documentation

## Auth0 Access Token Instructions
1. Setup a new Auth0 account or login to an existing Auth0 account
2. Configure Universal Login under Branding tab
3. Setup Auth0 API for your API endpoints
4. Create Auth0 Application (M2M app)
    1. Define application Allowed Callback URLs that are specific for Chariot. This allows OAuth callbacks to be sent to Chariot’s system after a user logs in to your application.
        1. Local - [http://localhost:8080/v1/callback](http://localhost:8080/callback)
        2. Staging - https://devapi.givechariot.com/v1/callback 
        3. Production - https://api.givechariot.com/v1/callback 
    2. Make a few decisions
        1. Choose an Authorization Flow (Grant Types) from Advanced Settings. We recommend Authorization Code Flow.
        2. Choose Token Endpoint Authentication Method. We suggest using default “Post” method.
        3. If you are using OIDC, ensure your application has OIDC discovery enabled (./well-known/openid-configuration endpoint)
    3. Give Chariot the necessary information about the M2M Auth0 application
        1. Issuer URL
        2. Client ID
        3. Client Secret
5. Give Chariot API Docs
