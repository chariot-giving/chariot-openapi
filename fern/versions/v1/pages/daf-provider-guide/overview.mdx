For DAF providers with OAuth authentication, we recommend integrating directly through [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC).

OIDC is an authentication protocol commonly used by consumer-facing SSO implementations that is built on top of the industry standard OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## Workflow Overview
1. Donor begins the Chariot flow and selects their DAF Provider.
2. Chariot’s server returns an ***Authorize URL,*** which launches in a popup window when the user continues to sign in. This URL is generated by communicating with the issuer and establishing the Chariot ***Callback URL***.
3. Chariot redirects the donor to the identity provider via the ***Authorize URL*** for authentication and sign-in.
4. The identity provider verifies the donor.
5. If verification is successful, the identity provider generates a token which it sends in the request (either as the payload or query parameters) to the configured Chariot ***Callback URL***.
6. The donor returns to the Chariot flow where they now can see information about their DAF Provider account including name and balance on the account.
7. The donor submits the grant request to their DAF Provider and completes the Chariot flow.


## Set-up

### Checklist for the OAuth Provider
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server (Okta, Auth0, or custom)
- OAuth 2.0 User Authorization Login Page (Universal Login for Okta/Auth0)
- OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Application for Chariot (we’ll need to register and configure Callback URLs for local, staging, and production environments).

### Required Information 

Please provide the following information needed for the integration:
1. `ISSUER_BASE_URL`: This is the URL for the Token issuer (identity provider)
2. `CLIENT_ID`: The unique identifier for the OAuth 2.0 client
3. `CLIENT_SECRET`: The unique secret for the same corresponding OAuth 2.0 client
4. DAF Provider API Endpoints and Documentation


## Estimated Integration Timeline

This depends highly on the current authentication and authorization schemes for your DAF. 

If you already uses Okta or Auth0 for Authentication and/or Authorization, integration should require one engineer for around 3 days. 

Chariot will need 2 weeks to build and test the integration.
