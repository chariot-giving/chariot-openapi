### Workflow

1. Donor begins the Chariot flow and selects their DAF Provider.
2. Chariotâ€™s server returns an ***Authorize URL,*** which launches in a popup window when the user continues to sign in. This URL is generated by communicating with the issuer and establishing the Chariot ***Callback URL***.
3. Chariot redirects the donor to the identity provider via the ***Authorize URL*** for authentication and sign-in.
4. The identity provider verifies the donor.
5. If verification is successful, the identity provider generates a token which it sends in the request (either as the payload or query parameters) to the configured Chariot ***Callback URL***.
6. The donor returns to the Chariot flow where they now can see information about their DAF Provider account including name and balance on the account.
7. The donor submits the grant request to their DAF Provider and completes the Chariot flow.

### Estimated Integration Timeline

This depends highly on the current authentication and authorization schemes for your DAF. If you already uses Okta or Auth0 for Authentication and/or Authorization, integration should require one engineer for around 3 days. 

Chariot will need 2 weeks to build and test the integration.
