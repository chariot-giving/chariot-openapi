## Checklist for the OAuth Provider

- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server (Okta, Auth0, or custom)
- OAuth 2.0 User Authorization Login Page (Universal Login for Okta/Auth0)
- OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Application for Chariot (we’ll need to register and configure Callback URLs for local, staging, and production environments).

## Authentication

All the API endpoints should be protected with OAuth authentication. This means the server will need to validate an access_token or an id_token (depending on the specific OAuth flow).
