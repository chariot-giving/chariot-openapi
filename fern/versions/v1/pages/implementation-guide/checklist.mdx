<Info> 
This guide assumes you have already been shared a `client_id` and `client_secret`. If that is not the case, please email [support@givechariot.com](mailto:support@givechariot.com).
</Info>

### Set Up
1. Generate Access Token: You'll need to create an access token that lets you access the APIs. Fill in the provided client_id and client_secret to in the provided code snippet and get an access token.
2. Create Nonprofit: The [Create nonprofit](/api/nonprofits/create) endpoint registers a new nonprofit or confirms its existence within the Chariot system. For registration, it's necessary to supply the nonprofit's EIN and details for a contact person at the nonprofit for Chariot's customer support purposes. Save the nonprofit's `id` to use in the next step.
3. Create Connect: The [Create Connect](/api/connects/create) endpoint creates a Connect record or retrieves it if a Connect already exists for this nonprofit in Chariot's system. To create a Connect, the nonprofit's `id` must be provided, which you should have from the previous step.

### Build Front End
1. Install Chariot Connect (DAFpay button) JavaScript package
2. Add the Connect ID generated above into the Chariot-Connect component
3. Place Chariot-Connect component where you want the DAFpay button to appear
4. Button Styles

### Configure Button
1. Pre-populate Data in Connect:
    - Disable button 
    - Autofilling donor info
2. Capture Grant Intent:
    - Data update in modal - donation amount change
3. Recurring Dontions:
4. Unintegrated DAF Providers
