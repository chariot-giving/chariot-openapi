This guide is intended to supplement the [Integrating DAFpay](/guides/dafpay/overview) documentation, providing key details and considerations essential for a successful integration.
We strongly encourage platforms to review this guide carefully before beginning the integration process.

We like to break down the integration process into three main steps:

<Steps>

### Nonprofit Onboarding

- **Creating CIDs**: Create and save down Connect IDs for your organizations which allow you to render the DAFpay button.
- **Creating Chariot Accounts**: Create Chariot accounts for your nonprofits to facilitate the transfer of funds.

### Donation Form Implementation

- **Placement & Conversion**: Ensure the DAFpay donation experience helps maximize donor engagement and increase conversion rates.
- **Donor Experience**: Provide a seamless and intuitive experience for donors to make donations using their Donor Advised Funds.

### Transaction Management

- **Flow of Funds**: Understand the flow of funds to ensure that donations are processed correctly by your organizations.
- **Reconciliation**: Tie DAF payments to DAFpay grants to ensure that all donations are accounted for.

</Steps>
