The Chariot documentation is broken up into three main parts: 

1. [Integrating DAFpay](integrating-connect): The frontend, client-side component that launches [DAFPay](https://www.dafpay.com/): the application that users interact with in order to authenticate with and initiate grant requests from their Donor Advised Funds. Both React and Javascript SDKs are available. 
2. [Using the API](overview): The backend APIs needed to register new nonprofits, submit grants, and query for transactional data and events. All endpoints much be authenticated using OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow.
3. [Implementation Guide](implementation): A collection of best practices and tips for integrating DAFpay into your platform.
