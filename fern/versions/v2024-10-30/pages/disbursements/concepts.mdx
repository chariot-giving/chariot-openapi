We envision a world where any nonprofit organization can receive payments securely and reliably via any open-network electronic payment method.

Let's define the terms and concepts that are fundamental to understanding how this works.

## Entity

An `Entity` represents a tax-exempt (as defined by the IRS) nonprofit or a fiscal sponsor for a charitable organization.
An entity is a legal entity with a name, EIN (Federal Tax ID), officers, and a physical address.
There are approximately 1.8M nonprofits in the US.

## Organization

An `Organization` represents an operating entity or an operating sub-organization of a parent or sponsoring entity.
Organizations can receive payments from payers on the network.
Organizations are associated with a web domain, logo, and a set of verified addresses where they can receive payments.

## Address

A `Address` is a public-facing identifier that can be used to send payments to an `Organization`.
An Organization is said to be "addressable" if it has at least one `Address`.
An Address can take many forms depending on the type of payment rail used:

### Postal Address

A postal address is a mailing address where physical mail can be received.
Postal addresses are used to send paper checks.

### US Bank Account

A US bank account is a financial account that can be used to securely receive electronic payments.
A bank account address is usually composed of an account number and a routing number.
The routing number is the American Bankers' Association (ABA) Routing Transit Number (RTN).
The account number is an identifier specific to the receiving bank that uniquely identifies an account that can receive payments.
Bank account addresses (account and routing numbers) can be used to send ACH, RTP, wire transfers, and FedNow payments.
