Chariot's API can be accessed via SDKs for several popular languages.
The SDKs are generated from our OpenAPI 3 [specification](https://github.com/chariot-giving/chariot-openapi/blob/main/specs).
The JSON specification may be helpful if you are looking to use a language we haven't implemented yet!

Our APIs are stable but we're just getting started with these SDKs,
so some things might change in future versions.
If you find them useful or have feedback, [please let us know]((mailto:support@givechariot.com))!

Using an SDK can speed up your integration by providing an implementation for pagination, serialization, timeouts, retries, and error handling.

## Node

Install our Node SDK with `npm` or `yarn`.
The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/chariot-giving/typescript-sdk).
Request parameters, response bodies, and error details are all typed with Typescript.

```sh
$ npm install --save @chariot-giving/typescript-sdk
# or
$ yarn add @chariot-giving/typescript-sdk
```

## More coming soon!

Let us know if you'd like to be an early adopter or if there's another language we should support.
