The Chariot API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Chariot Dashboard.

<Aside>
    <Info>
    Test mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_test_` and live mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_live_`.

    ```curl
    curl https://api.givechariot.com/organizations \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc"
    ```

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure!
Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Bearer Token. Provide your API key as the `Authentication: Bearer {TOKEN}` value.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
