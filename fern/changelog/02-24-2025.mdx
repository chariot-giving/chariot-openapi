Authentication Update: Transition from OAuth 2.0 to API Keys

### What's new?

We've updated our authentication method from OAuth 2.0 to API Keys. This change simplifies the
integration process by eliminating the need to manage token expiration and refresh cycles.
With API Keys, you can authenticate requests more straightforwardly, reducing the complexity of
maintaining session states.
