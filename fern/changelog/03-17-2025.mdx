## Summary

Grantmaking Disbursement APIs (Beta)

### What's new?

We've added new Guides and APIs to make it easier for grantmaking platforms to disburse payments to nonprofits.

These new APIs are currently in beta and are available as part of a pilot program with a handful of design partners.
If you're interested in trying them out, please reach out to us at contact@givechariot.com to get on the waitlist!
