## Updated API Version (beta)

New beta version of the Chariot documentation available [here](/v2024-10-30).

### What's new?

We've revamped our existing APIs and added new ones to make it easier for grantmaking platforms to send payments to nonprofits.

These new APIs are currently in beta and are available as part of a pilot program with a handful of design partners.
If you're interested in trying them out, please reach out to us at contact@givechariot.com to get on the waitlist!
