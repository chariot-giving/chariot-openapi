## Summary

Header API Key In List Grant APIs

### What's new?

We've remove the `x-chariot-api-key` header from the List Grants API as a requirement. In the past, this header was used to filter the list of grants by a specific Connect. This is no longer necessary as the `connect_id` query parameter can be used for this purpose instead.
