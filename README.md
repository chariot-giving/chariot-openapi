# chariot-openapi

Chariot uses the `OpenAPI 3.0.0` specification to schematize our [docs](https://docs.givechariot.com)
and to generate our supported client libraries.
This provides for a consistent typing experience across our external interfaces.

## Code Generation

You can find examples on the official [OpenApiGenerator docs](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#3---usage)
for how to automatically generate client libraries from the provided specs.
